# HoloCrystal – Open Volumetric Display Project
*(Technical name: Photon Matrix)*

## Overview
HoloCrystal is an open-source volumetric display project based on the Photon Matrix architecture.  
It combines multi-layer optical modules with high-speed projection to produce spatial images that appear as true 3D objects in mid-air.  

The project is in the prototype validation stage and is fully open to encourage global collaboration.

## Technical Vision
Our goal is to create a scalable, cost-effective, and high-quality volumetric display platform.  
While true holographic systems remain expensive and complex, Photon Matrix seeks a practical balance between:
- **Performance** – Smooth parallax and multi-depth rendering
- **Cost** – Affordable optical and control components
- **Scalability** – Modular architecture for future expansion

---

## System Highlights
- **High-Speed Projection** – >240 Hz projection driving multiple layers  
- **Multi-Layer Optical Panels** – Optical diffusion or fast-switching liquid crystal  
- **Precise Synchronization** – Hardware-level timing for frame-to-layer switching  
- **Layered Rendering Pipeline** – Pre-sliced depth images for volumetric playback  

For more details, see the [Technical Whitepaper](whitepaper.md).
