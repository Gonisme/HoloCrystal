HoloCrystal: A Radical Quest to Realize True Volumetric Holography

“We're not building a product. We're building the last true hologram.”

Project Description

HoloCrystal is an independent experimental initiative devoted to creating real-space, multi-angle, unaided-eye volumetric holograms—not optical illusions, not spinning mirrors, not fog tricks. We aim for actual light convergence within physical matter using crystalline blocks and coordinated multi-projector systems.

This is not a startup. This is not a product launch.This is a scientific rebellion against visual compromise.

The Mission

We aim to:

Create visible, volumetric light points within transparent media (e.g., K9 glass, acrylic)

Achieve RGB light convergence from multiple angles into a defined 3D voxel grid

Eliminate dependency on eye-tracking, headsets, spinning structures, or volumetric fog

Document every failure and partial success with openness and rigor

Invite collaboration from physicists, optical engineers, and artists alike

Current Status (2025 Type1 Phase)

Tested materials: K9 crystal, solid acrylic blocks, layered acrylic

Prototyped various voxel spacings (0.5mm, 0.75mm, 1mm)

Observed issues: ghosting, shadowing, poor contrast, RGB separation, convergence failure

Confirmed advantages of side-entry projection over front-entry

Attempted 4-projector passive sync at 60Hz (targeting >240Hz per axis)

Detected occasional RGB clustering, but no coherent volumetric image

Key Observations

Light convergence points often form luminous blobs instead of crisp voxels

Internal reflections and refraction scatter projected paths

Surface imagery dominates, drowning out volumetric presence

Strong angular color biases observed (e.g., red dominance on right, green on left)

Flicker and ghosting persist under 1000fps conditions; high-speed projection may be essential

“光之所在，即真實顯現。”
HoloCrystal
Just  like a dream, a vision, a bubble, a shadow,
Like tears in rain, 
Like flash of lightning,
This is the way to comprehend all conditioned phenomena.
