# HoloCrystal – Open Source Volumetric Display Project

**中文版請見 [README_zh.md](README_zh.md)**

## Introduction
HoloCrystal is an experimental volumetric display technology that leverages light fields and scattering media to generate visible 3D point clouds in real space. This project is released under an open-source license to invite engineers and researchers worldwide to collaborate.

## Technical Vision
By precisely controlling beams and scattering materials, we aim to achieve true 3D image display viewable from multiple angles, without bulky optical systems — ultimately enabling real-time dynamic holographic projection.
